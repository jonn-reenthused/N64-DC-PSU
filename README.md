*** IN DEVELOPMENT, ALWAYS TEST VOLTAGES BEFORE CONNECTING TO ANYTHING YOU DON'T WANT TO BLOW UP ***

Tested on a Japanese N64 and a PAL (UK) N64. Had it running for a couple of hours with a normal cartridge and a flash cart with no obvious issues.

Haven't tested it with any peripheral though, like the N64DD or any duplication devices.

The pins are the hardest part to source, a joiner crimp part will probably work. I'm going to design a pin shroud to help keep them stable.
